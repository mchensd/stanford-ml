Neuron model:
	“dendrites” - feed input such as x1 . . . xn
	“axon” - output, computation such as h(x)

	input layer -> hidden layer -> output layer
	
	transition from input -> hidden: linear combination of input layer to get jth unit in hidden layer
	
	Thetaj: matrix for mapping from layer j to layer j+1, ith row are weights for calculating ith node int j+1th layer

	
	Forward Propagation: Vectorized implementation
		z(2) = theta(1)a(1)
		a(2) = g(z(2))
	
		z(3) = theta(2)a(2)
		h(x) = a(3) = g(z(3))


Application:
	boolean logic - 

Multi class
	h(x) is now in Rn, n is number of classes
